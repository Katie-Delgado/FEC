# Forbes-Image-Gallery-Review

## Goal
  <ul>
    <li>Build the provided application using the image API of your choosing. Test both functionality and code by running the application and reviewing the syntax/code.</li>
  </ul>

## Prerequisites
  <ul>
    <li>Identify an API that contains images related to a theme of your choosing. Update the code to utilize these images.</li>
    <li>run application by executing `npm i && npm start` from its root directory</li>
    <li>http-server: ^0.12.3</li>
  </ul>
    
## Instructions
   <ul>
      <li>Build the html/js/css application.</li>
      <li>Verify the images API chosen is loading correctly.</li>
      <li>Test the application's usability, functionality, and business logic.</li>
      <li>Perform a thorough code review of the 'Main.js' file only.</li>
      <li>Leave comments inline as code comments with the key `@COMMENT` before your remarks.</li>
      ** NOTE: Style improvements are not required but are encouraged, time permitting.<br>
  </ul>
  
## Technical Considerations
  <ul>
      <li>Any code modifications should be done in vanilla JS (no frameworks, or libraries)</li>
      <li>Your application only needs to work in Chrome</li>
      <li>Evaluate and provide feedback based on architecture, approach, style, exceptions and whatever else you believe is relevant toward helping the author    deliver a solid feature.</li>
      <li>Take responsive design into consideration</li>
  </ul>
